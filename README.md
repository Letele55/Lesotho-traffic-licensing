# Lesotho-traffic-licensing

A website basically built to issue driving license to citizens. Citizens can apply for learner's license, driving license, vehicle registration and monitor the status of application. Citizens can also submit complaints/queries.

Here are the steps to run the project:
1. Install XAMPP for Windows.
2. After doing whatever is mentioned in step 1, create a database with the name 'licensing-lesotho' (that's the name I gave to the database while
   running the project).
3. After creating that database name import the sql file 'licensing-lesotho'.
4. Create file in the htdocs.
5. Remember to unzip the assets file
6. Run the project  with this directory localhost/License/index.php.
7. Then from ther one can register.
8. Three actors can log in admin, department officer, and the citizens.
9. login admin@gmail.com(5678), department@gmail.com(3456) and limp@gmail(1234)

NB: for now there is just a database, home page, register page, and the login page
